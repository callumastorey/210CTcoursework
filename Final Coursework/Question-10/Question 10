"""Description"""

"""This is a program to extract the largest sub-sequence in an ascending order from a given sequence.
It works by iterating through each element in a list e.g. [1,2,3,1,5] and calculating whether it
is larger than the previous element, if so add to list. If the element is smaller, a new list is
created. Once iterated through all of the elements within the list. A list containing the sub lists
is printed. The largest is then printed along with the number of elements in the largest sub-sequence.
