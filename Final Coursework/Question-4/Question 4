###QUESTION 4###

"""
Big O Notations


Question 1:
In question 1 we have a function that contains one for loop. Because
this for loop can run any number of times, dependant on given variables
the big o notation is 0(n).

Question 2:
In question2 we have 2 functions that both contain 1 while loop, if there
was a nested while loop we would have a different result as our worst case
scenario but in this case the big o notation is also 0(n).

Question 3:
This question is a bit different, rather than having a for or while loop, the
function purely contains 4 lines of code that does one job. Therefore this
function can only run once. This means we have a big o notation of 0(1).
